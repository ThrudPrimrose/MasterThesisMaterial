# Improved GPU Kernel Generation for SeisSol using Loop-over-GEMM and Sparse-Matrix Operations

The complete Master Thesis will be added to the repository when it is submitted.

Until then, the link for the [Master Thesis](https://www.overleaf.com/read/fznnfwbpwrxb).
If there are problems the link as text: https://www.overleaf.com/read/fznnfwbpwrxb.

## Gemmforge and YaTeTo

For the master thesis various improvements for [Gemmforge](https://github.com/SeisSol/gemmforge) and [YaTeTo](https://github.com/SeisSol/yateto) were implemented.
For Gemmforge there are 2 branches related to tensor support ([tensor-support](https://github.com/SeisSol/gemmforge/tree/tensor-support)) and ([sparse-matrix operation](https://github.com/SeisSol/gemmforge/tree/tensor-support))
For YaTeTo changes were implemented on my [fork](https://github.com/ThrudPrimrose/yateto) of it.

The plan is to combine both branches and open up a merge request.

## Results and Other Details

Can be read in my master thesis.

I have also occasionally used the scripts available in this repository as a starting point ([latex-figures](https://github.com/xinychen/awesome-latex-drawing)).
